# Trade Republic API

## Authenticating

Use `tr.http` to get a `tr_session` cookie. Send this with every `WebSocket`
request.

## Connecting to a WebSocket

WebSocket URL

`wss://api.traderepublic.com/`

Send this as the first request:

`connect 26 {"locale":"de","platformId":"webtrading","platformVersion":"chrome - 114.0.0","clientId":"app.traderepublic.com","clientVersion":"1.22.5"}`

The `clientVersion` might change in the future but can be retrieved from here:

`https://app.traderepublic.com/app-version.txt`
